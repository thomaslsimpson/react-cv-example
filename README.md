# Step 1: Create the Empty Component

First, I created a blank CVContainer.js component. It did nothing. But, by setting this up, I was able to make sure that
React is working probperly, that my build tools are working properly, and I can even deploy to the product site to make 
sure that my deployment is working.

CI means working in tiny increments and deploying these all he time. It means maintaining a build that always works.
